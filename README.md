# 📧 Email Spam Detection  

## 📌 Project Overview  
Spam emails are a significant nuisance, causing clutter, security risks, and phishing attacks. This project aims to **automate spam filtering** using **machine learning and natural language processing (NLP)** techniques.  

By analyzing email content, we can classify messages as **spam or legitimate**, enhancing email security and management.

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset consists of email samples labeled as **spam** or **ham (not spam)**. Each email contains textual content, subject lines, and metadata, providing valuable insights for classification.

## 📜 Project Steps  
1️⃣ **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**  
   - Convert text to lowercase, remove punctuation & special characters.  
   - Tokenize and apply **stopword removal & stemming/lemmatization**.  

2️⃣ **Feature Engineering**  
   - Convert text into numerical representations (**TF-IDF, Bag of Words**).  

3️⃣ **Model Development & Training**  
   - Train models: **MiniBatch K-mean**.  
   - Compare performance using **accuracy, precision**.  

4️⃣ **Performance Evaluation**  
   - Use **ROC-AUC Curve** to assess model effectiveness.  
   - Optimize models with **hyperparameter tuning**.  

5️⃣ **Spam Pattern Analysis**  
   - Explore **common spam keywords** and clustering patterns.  
   - Identify how **phishing and promotional emails** differ from legitimate ones.
